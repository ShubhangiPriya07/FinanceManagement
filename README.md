# Financify – Personal Budget & Finance Tracker

## Project Description
Financify is a simple and interactive personal budgeting web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It helps users understand, track, and control their financial 
activities by recording income and expenses, categorizing spending, and displaying real-time financial summaries. The project focuses on DOM manipulation and client-side data 
handling using localStorage.

## Problem Statement
Managing personal finances is often difficult due to lack of awareness about income, expenses, and spending patterns. Many individuals do not clearly understand where their 
money goes, leading to poor financial decisions. This project aims to solve that problem by providing a simple budgeting tool that visually represents income, expenses, and 
balance, helping users make informed financial decisions.
